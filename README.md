# Wild Mage Gets Into Trouble

### 7DRL 2022

### How to play

Start the game by running "Wild-Mage-Gets-Into-Trouble.exe" file. If default font size (18) is too small or too large for you, you may use fs flag to set custom font size, e.g. "Wild-Mage-Gets-Into-Trouble.exe -fs 12". For all Linux users: I am sorry, there is no Linux build available right now. Will try to make one later.

Player has three spells at the disposal: can spreat fire, cause flood, and create chasms by removing ground.
No matter what happen, ground will go back to the normal state after some time.

Controls:

- arrows: move
- \[, numpad /: previous spell
- \], numpad \*: next spell
- -, numpad -: smaller area of effect of the spell
